Data Types:

Some basic data types are int and string. You can create your own data type after class.
For example:

class Person{

    }

After you have done that, then you can start adding the common datat types like int to add some characteristics to your data type. For example, if it is a mammal, then you can add how maany legs it has. Is it male or female, etc. Thi sis like adding a lego block on top of another lego block. Here for instance:

 class Person{
        int age;
        int name;
        int grade;
        int height;
        int weight;
    }

Now the data type is complete!


If you are trying to create multiple data types of your own but keep the variables similar, you can do the following:
 
Person person1 = new Person();
    person1.name = "sai1";
    person1.age = 12;
    
    Person person2 = new Person();
    person1.name = "sai2";
    person1.age = 15;

    System.out.println(person1.name + " age is:" + person1.age);
    System.out.println(person2.name + " age is:" + person2.age);
		
When to put a semi-colon at the ned and when not to. When you are deciding whether to put a semi-colon at the end, they usually refer to the code as if you were reading it in English. Sometimes it the code is not formatted how you would be reading or comprehending English, then the semi-colon is not required. will remove
