In this program, we have something called a scanner.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Application {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.print("first number:");
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		int firstNumber = scanner.nextInt();
		
		System.out.print("second number:");
		int secondNumber = scanner.nextInt();

In above we are declaring variable scanner of type Scanner.

This is how you figure out the answer to a basic problem.

int x = 5;
		int y = 2;
		System.out.println(x/y);

		double x1 = 5;
		double y1 = 2;
		System.out.println(x1/y1);

The system.out.println will print what you have given it. You have given it to print the x/y in the first field.

Pseudo logic:

Here we need to print 10 times starting from 1
We can think of something like this
number = user input
starting from 1 to 10
    number * counter

This is like making the program do the work for you.
