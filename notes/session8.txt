Class is the technical term for creating a data type.

Object is a technical term creating variable.

Fields: What we are calling a class properties are called fields in Java terminology

For example, these are different fields:

class Person{
    String name;        // field name of type String
    int age;            // field age of type int
}

// creating object and accessing fields
Person p1 = new Person();
p1.name = "sai";
p1.age = 16;

Methods: What we have called Actions(which are verbs) are called Methods in Java terminology

For example:

class Car{
    void start(){
        System.out.println("starting the car");
    }

    void stop(){
        System.out.println("stopping the car");
    }
}

// accessing methods
Car c1 = new Car();
c1.start();
c1.stop();

This is the output of a program:
starting
stopping
starting
stopping

This is an example output:

starting : bmw which has:200 horse power
stopping: bmw
starting : honda which has:50 horse power
stopping: honda

Boolean: This data type is used when your data value can take only yes or no. Like did you go to school? you have either yes or no. Are you taking chemistry class this year? yes or no.

For example:

Me:  Start the car
You: Starting
Me:  Start
You: Sorry , you have started already. You need to stop before starting again.
