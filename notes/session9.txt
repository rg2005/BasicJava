The connection between methods and fields in class are that Methods in class can access fields.

Encapsulation:

The Object Oriented Programming (OOPs for short) is what the Java langauge is based upon. 


The second part of encapsulation is where you have a lot of items and you need to write programs or commands for each item like how a car functions. 

Well, lets write a car class where you have to write a lot of things in order for a car to function.

For example:

public class Car {
	String name;
	int horsePower;
	boolean isStarted = false;	// used to indicate whether is is started or not.

	void putGasInChamber() {
		System.out.println("putting gas in chamber");
	}
	
	void igniteChamber() {
		System.out.println("Igniting chamber");
	}
	
	void moveWheels() {
		System.out.println("moving wheels");
	}
}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Car c1 = new Car();
		c1.name = "bmw";
		c1.horsePower = 200;

        // You need to do all these things just moving the car.
		c1.putGasInChamber();
		c1.igniteChamber();
		c1.moveWheels();
	}
