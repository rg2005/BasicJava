Recap: 


Methods are nothing but actions. An example of a method is run.

An example of the syntax how you would format the method is doHomework,eatPie,etc.

The void is soething taht doesn't have a return unlike int.

Boolean is allowing you to do something or not do something. 

For example:

 boolean eatPie(){
	return true; //or retrun false

The return means that you are allowing it to do something. True means allowed and false means blocked.

Constructor is really nothing but a special type of method. The constructor can be a method but the same name
as the class. It doesn't have a return data type to it.


There is a special keyword that you can use and that is the this.
 this. can be used for identifying which of repeated objects that you are using.

For example, age = age;
you can use this.age = age and for anotehr instance, this.name = name.
