Computer=Hardware+Software

Some examples of hardware are, GPU, CPU, HDD, etc.

CPU- It is the central processing unit.

Decimal System:

All of you know the decimal system which we use on daily basis. Lets take the number: 546. You have learned the number system with place value like ones place, tenth ,hundredth place and so on.
Given above number 546 we can write like : (5 * 100) + (4 * 10) + (6 * 1)
Also can be written as (5* 10^2) + (4 * 10^1) + (6 * 10^0)
In this system every number is between 0-9 (total 10 numbers) and base called 10. Deca is 10 and hence it is called decimal.

Binary: It is a language which computers can understand and that is the only language that computers can understand.

To convert binary to decimal, 
split the number in multiple of 2
for ex: 83
64+16+2+1
remember in binary place values are multiple of 2
in above we have missing 4, 8, 32 means it will be zero in the place
start from last number
1 is mean 1 ( 1)
2 means second place 1 ( 11 )
4 missing meaning third place 0 ( 011 )
8 missing meaning fourth place 0 ( 0011 )
16 means fifth place 1 ( 10011)
32 missing means 6th place 0 ( 010011)
64 means 7th place 1 ( 1010011)
1010011
